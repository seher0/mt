add context window

predict confidence for predicted label seq


use word2vec/glove embedding to initialize
buckets + add weights for ignoring pad ids for each bucket


================

dump label_vocab.json - print transformed output

model changes - birnn, (D - worse on tests, overfits? maybe needs early stopping)

(D)correct output vocabulary: only num_tag_labels + 4 beginning symbols

def contextwin(l, win):
    '''
    win :: int corresponding to the size of the window
    given a list of indexes composing a sentence

    l :: array containing the word indexes

    it will return a list of list of indexes corresponding
    to context windows surrounding each word in the sentence
    '''
    assert (win % 2) == 1
    assert win >= 1
    l = list(l)

    lpadded = win // 2 * [-1] + l + win // 2 * [-1]
    out = [lpadded[i:(i + win)] for i in range(len(l))]

    assert len(out) == len(l)
    return out
